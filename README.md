# Project Overview  
This project is a weather application for our Capstone I class. We used Python to access the National Weather Service API and Flask to send data from the backend to the frontend. HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used to get the data and display it on the frontend.
  
# Motivations  
Many weather applications today are cluttered with excessive options, overwhelming interfaces, and intrusive advertisements, making it difficult for users to quickly access essential weather information. This complexity detracts from the primary goal of a weather appâ€”providing clear, concise, and reliable forecasts immediately. Users often struggle to navigate through unnecessary features, leading to frustration and inefficiency. This project aims to create a streamlined weather app that prioritizes simplicity, delivering only the most relevant weather updates in an intuitive and ad-free experience.
